# Pulumi AWS s3 Python Module

This module is under construction and does just the basics. Some assumed defaults are configured that will later be refactored. 

Note that use of this module is intended to create resources which will incur monetary charges on your AWS bill. Run `pulumi destroy` when you no longer need these resources.

Experimenting with reusable Pulumi python modules. Kinda like terraform modules except Pulumi python.
